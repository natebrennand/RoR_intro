#Homework 2

DUE: by April 7th 11:59pm (night before our third class)

1) Add the Mongoid gem to your app.  Set up a mongoid.yml file.

2) Design a schema for the following resources.  In other words, determine what attributes each should have and what the association is between each.

* User
* Course
* Lecture
* Assignment
* Upload

3) Use rails scaffolding to create the above resources.  Make sure you add the associations to the model files, scaffolding won't do it for you.

4) Use the rails console to create some objects and their associated objects.

__Bonus__: create a polymorphic association between lectures and uploads
